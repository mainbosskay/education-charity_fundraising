Conclusion

As a result of conducting research on the datasets EFO_Donation_Data and EFO_Donor_Data, we were able to gain a better understanding of the business challenge faced by Education for ALL regarding how to increase their donations, increase their donors and increase the donation frequency.

The data includes males and females of both sexes, persons of varying shirt sizes, and job fields, as well as a wide range of cars makes and models and educational backgrounds.

I discovered that there are 46 states with fewer than 80 donors, and that donors with university education are more numerous than those without university education among those who donates between $5 and $249.

Based on my examination of the data, I can say that the legal job field has the less donors and the smallest number of donations ($17,309 out of $249,085).

After observing that the legal job field received the fewest donations and donors, I decided to conduct research in that area. When I investigated the top ten donors in the legal field, I discovered that the majority are female and the vast majority (70%) university education. Then I looked into the least ten donors in the legal field and discovered that they are overwhelmingly male and comprise 60% of people with university education.

In conclusion, the datasets should include more information, like job hierarchy and years of experience, instead of the movie genre and shirt sizes.
We need to figure out how to get the word out to more men in the legal field and those who do not have a university degree about the Education for All charity and how their donations can help a lot of individuals. In addition, by demonstrating the impact of past donations, we can inspire current donors to increase their support.
