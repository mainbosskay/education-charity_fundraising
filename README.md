The scenario presented to me was that I am a data analyst for the charity, Education for ALL. The Head of fundraising has requested that I give a presentation on donor insights and donation rates. My goal with the fundraising team includes.
• Increase the number of donors in your database.
• Increase the donation frequency of your donors.
• Increase the value of donations in your database.
In two weeks, I must deliver insights from the donation data to my team and inform my fundraising strategy to boost donations for the following year.
I used the datasets EFO_Donation_Data and EFO_Donor_Data to answer the business problem. I employed the following SQL commands to analyse the data:
• JOIN
• SELECT
• WHERE
• LEFT JOIN
• ON
• ORDER BY ()
• GROUP BY ()
• HAVING
• LIMIT
• DESC
• ASC
• SUM()
• COUNT ()
• MAX()
• MIN()
• AVG()
• ROUND ()
• OR
I used root cause analysis to go deep into the issue and determine the best follow-up inquiries. As a result, I was able to gain critical insights from the data sets provided, create appropriate visualisations, and write a report for my team.
