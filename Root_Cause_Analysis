The charity organisation Education for All is facing a challenging business environment because expanding their funding base is difficult. They need to find more donors who can contribute on a consistent basis and add financial value to their contributions.
In two weeks, I had to give a report. In order to get a handle on the situation, I analysed databases containing information about Donors and their donations. In addition, I need to show off some vital statistics and data visualisations.
I decided to probe the issue further by using root cause analysis to ask the following questions:
• Why are there not enough donation for the charity?
A: because there are no regular donations for the charity.
• Why are there not regular donations for the charity?
A: because we do not have enough donors for the charity.
• Why are there not enough donors for the charity?
A: because only few job fields have heard about the charity.
• Why have only few job fields heard about the charity?
A: because enough advertisement has not been made concerning the charity.
