-- Findings and Recommendations

Following the analysis of the data sets, I came to the following findings:
• The total sum of donation is $249085.
• The average donation rounds up to two decimal places is $249.09.
• The minimum amount of donations is $5.
• The maximum amount of donations is $500.
• The total number of donors is 1000.

It is obvious that only 753 of the 1000 donors identified in the database are active. Consequently, 247 donors don't donate. The 247 inactive donors should be enlightened and motivated to start making donations. Also, the findings clearly demonstrate that weekly donors are the least active donors and, as a result, contribute the least to the total donations. The total number of donors and amount donated may be increased if the 247 inactive donors were urged to give on a weekly basis.

46 states have fewer than 80 donors. Most states have fewer donors. Hence, those states should promote more contributions.
The following table provides information regarding the number of university- educated male and female donors who contributed between $5 and $249

176 male and 198 female university degree holders donated between $5 and $249. This shows that 374 educated people donate, which means that 37.4% of the total donors donate between $5 and $249.

There were 75 women and 55 men without college degrees who contributed between $5 and $249. This demonstrates that 130 individuals who do not possess a degree from auniversity contributed, which indicates that 13.0% of the total donors contributed between $5 and $249.

The data presented reveals that three job fields have less than 80 donors. On the other hand, more charitable awareness training should be provided to people working in this sector of the economy.

The results show that people in the LEGAL job field donate only once, and there are fewer people who donate weekly. Hence, people should be encouraged to donate more than once.

Most Donors who donate the most in the Legal job field have university education
